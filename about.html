      <p>Grendel is a monster living in a world ruled by humans. I kind of sympothize with him. To him, hes just lashing out trying to be normal. But to others, its horrible what hes doing and they don't even give him a chance.</p>
      <p>
“The sky says nothing, predictably. I make a face, uplift a defiant middle finger, and give an obscene little kick. The sky ignores me, forever unimpressed. Him too I hate, the same as I hate these brainless budding trees, those brattling birds.” (Gardner 6)
</p>
<p>	Grendel is frustrated with himself and the world. He is angry because no one will talk to him.
</p>
<p>I dont think grendel meant to grow up and kill people. He just doesnt know any better because no one will accept him. </p>
<p>“So it goes with me day by day and age by age, I tell myself. Locked in the deadly progression of moon and stars. I shake my head, muttering darkly on shaded paths, holding conversation with the only friend and comfort this world allows, my shadow.” (Gardner 8)
</p>
<p>And although grendel is all alone, I can also see why even if he was a human people wouldnt like him. He is lazy and takes the easy way out. He lives in self pity and blames everything on the world around him.</p>
<p>“It is a matter of fact that I never killed a deer in all my life, and never will. Cows have more meat and, locked up in pens, are easier to catch.” (Gardner 8)
</p>
<p>He tries claming its more efficent, but I think he is just being lazy and that is another reason he is all alone. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Although he may be lazy, he does still try to talk to the people of Hrothgar, but has trouble getting it across.</p>
<p>“I twisted, letting out a howl, and shot past my shoulder just barely touching my skin. Blood trickled out. “You’re all crazy,” I try to yell, but it came out a moan.” </p>
<p>Grendel is one of those types of people that is differet, but not necissarly in a bad way. Well not in his eyes anyway. I think what Garder was trying to get at here was we need to look at people and others from their perspective. Just because something seems wrong to us, doesn't mean it is to them.</p>
<p>
“I was sickened, if only, at the waste of it: all they killed, cows, horses, men, they left to rot or burn. I sacked all I could and tried to store it, but my mother would growl and make faces because of the stink” (Gardner 39)
</p>
<p>For example in this quote, we can see that Grendel does not like all the waste of a battle and even tries to help them. But it is not seen as help to them but disrespect. </p>
